# Text based RPG game character creation

This is assignment 2 for the Experis Academy.

For this assignment we were handed a fairly extensive project description.  
We were tasked with creating an RPG (Role Playing Game) character creation application which is able to create, and equip characters with weapons and armor.  
This application is purely text based and will only show the output int the console.  

Main goal was to challenge our design and modeling skills using *design patterns* like ***Strategy***, ***Factory*** or ***Builder***.  
The use of design patters was not a requirement, but strongly suggested for easier development.  

### When first starting the program
When starting the program you are greeted with 6 options:

All of these choices have been pre-programmed to run.  
This means that the only control the user has is which option to run first.  

Below here I've added some images from the outputs:

Please feel free to fork or download the repo for your own testing.
